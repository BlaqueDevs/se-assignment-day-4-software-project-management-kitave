## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Both methodologies are used in software  development and project management. In contrast agile is an iterative and incremental approach while waterfall is a linear and sequential method. Waterfall is advantegeous in that  it is easy to manage due to its rigidity while it is disadvantageous as it is difficult to accomodate changes. Agile is advantegous in that it accomodates changes but its disadvantage is that it has less predictability.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Waterfall is benefitial in projects that have a rigid structure eg construction project while agile is more beneficial where quick response to changes is needed eg when developing a website

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Carrying out practices like quality control and quality assurance  while carrying out regular tests to ensure its functionality and meeting the quality standards.It is important to maintain high standards so that the software becomes of high quality.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
It can help by showing key areas in need of focus hence able to craft and develop a solution targeting the specific areas thus leading to efficient allocation of resources.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
I will do that by explaining the core issues the software plans to address and highlighting the key features and functionalities that make the solution effective.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
The adaptability,its tool intergration,its creative abilities and natural language understanding.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
The competitive landscape,consumer behaviour,industry trends and historical data of past markets.

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Understanding market trends can help gain information such technological advancements and shifts in consumer behaviour which can help in developing a software that is up to date and meeting the users needs
